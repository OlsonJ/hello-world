===================

//I am a transferring CS student (considering CS&E but not sure yet) and I love code. I am a beginner so even after introduction to  //structered programming, I find it difficult getting the hang of code. I hope to soon increase my programming skills in C++ and then //expand on my programming knowledge by learning Java and Python! Next semester I am learning assembly language and Data structures with //C++ next semester and I am looking forward to the knowledge!
